Here is my submission for the first assignment.

The functions and implementations for the exercises can be found in the file "source_exercise1.py".
The analysis which contains the plots used in the report can be found in the file "analysis_exercise1.ipynb"
In order to get the animations made for the wave equation and time dependent diffusion equation you can run
"python wave_equation_animation.py" and "python diffusion_equation_animation.py" respectively.

In order to keep the code running correctly make sure all files in the archive are present in the same directory.

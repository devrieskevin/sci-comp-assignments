Here is my submission for the second assignment (exercise set 2).

The functions and implementations for the exercises can be found in the file "source_exercise2.py".
The analysis which contains the plots used in the report can be found in the file "analysis_exercise2.ipynb"

In order to get the animation made for the numerical solutions of the Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion equations you can run
"python gray_scott_animation.py [f value] [k value] [D_u value] [D_v value]" where the parameters of the Gray-Scott equation
have to be passed to the program as command line arguments.

In order to keep the code running correctly make sure all files in the archive are present in the same directory.
